# Video Generation Scenarios & Model Configuration

**Purpose**: Scenario-to-model mapping for ambiguous cases.

**Usage**: Read this only when user intent doesn't clearly match a specific model choice in SKILL.md.

**Fallback Source of Truth**: Exact automatic fallback pairs are defined only in `fallback_models.json` and consumed by `scripts/run_task.py`. This file selects primary models and params; do not treat it as the authoritative fallback mapping.
